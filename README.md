<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  This project aims to provide football/soccer superfans with an application to quickly and easily plan their trips around European match schedules. Keeping track of matches across different soccer leagues, dates, and times can often be a difficult task for fans, especially those traveling from outside of Europe. Our application will allow users to select matches they want to watch from any league, and will automatically deselect any games with conflicting times. In the future, we'll add a trip-planning feature that can store these selections and form an itinerary with each game. This project is a work-in-process and will continue to be updated and improved going forward.
